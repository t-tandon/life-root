# Sequence Alignments

This folder contains multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) used for phylogenetic analysis.

### Tools Used

- [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)
- [CD-HIT](https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit) (for sequence redundancy reduction)

### Note
Inspect MSAs visually (e.g., alan_dt, Jalview) before tree building.
